### Summary
The paper highlights the future of research in the blockchain and green iot solutions. The paper covers the virtual powerplant idea as an aggregation of prosumers and discusses the needs for democratization of energy by tracking the distributed cost of energy consumption. Fog Computing seems to be the best way for blockchain technologies in IoT to be adopted in the energy sector because it circumvents the computational and security needs for a mature network by utilizing existing infrastructure built at wind and solar sites. The paper offers an insight into the use of IoT in the energy sector by providing the breakdown of the most important component to energy constumption, HVAC follwoed by lighting. These two components can be controlled by blockchain solutions and have a great. impact. Leading to the idea that a transformation of the grid can occur when IoT networks transform the energy sector forom a centralized supply chain into a decentralized , smart and optimized system.

### Notes
- It highlights future research to be focused on Blockhain and Green IoT solutions
- VPP is an aggregation of prosumers
- Democratization of energy will enable new ways to track and distribute cost of energy consumption
- Distributed computing techniques can increase security, and save energy in the IoT network, but crates complex architecture
- Fog computing can ease the adoption of blockchain technologies in IoT (due to the computational needs , places like wind/solar sites may have the infrastructure to provide it)
- IoT Based powerplants can save 230M , and IoT retrofitted powerplants can save 50M over the course of its lifetime
- Examples of IoT in practice :
	- Detection if Energy Demeand exceeds grid capacity
	- Optimizing consumption and generation using far-sighted strategies
	- Active voltage management to reduce Transmission and Distribution Line losses
	- Reduction of non-technical losses using smart meter network
- Half of residential energy consumption is due to HVAC 
- About 20% of residential consumption is due to lighting
- Energy solutions in the residentail space would benefit from IoT management of HVAC and Lighting systems
- Energy eindustry will transform from centralized supply chain into a decentralized, smart, and optimized

### Summary

### Notes
- Information Flow can be overlaid on top of the Power Flow and labeled as WAN (Wide area network),NAN (nieghbordhood area network),HAN(Home Area Network) or FAN (field area network0, in accordance with Generation,Transmission,Distribution, and Consumption
- Electric vehicles can be charged or discharged in multiple ways when paired with a home. V2G , vehicle to grid, V2V , vehicle to vehicle, and V2H vehicle to home . All of these methods can be used by EV's to participate in the market as prosumers
- Smart Grid adds three main things to power grid
	- remote controlling and monitoring
	- reporting to consumer
	- integration of renewable and distributed energy resrouces
- Smart grid has 4 main subsystems
	- power generation
	- power transmission
	- power distribution
	- power utilization
- Smart grids with IoT enable
	- information flow
	- power flow
	- distribution flow
-Smart Grids use smart meters over General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) of other mobile networks
- Standards are not yet established for IoT aided SG
- This survey reveals that there is little literature on the application of IoT-aided SG systems in the area of power generation, transmission and utilization. The potential of renewable energy may depend, for example, on IoT-based prediction of weather conditions that can regulate energy flow between different regions, and on monitoring the efficiency of the involved equipment (solar panels, wind turbines).
- SGAM (Smart Grid Architecture Model) which is designed for SG planning and is the SG reference architecture by EU Mandate M/490
- REal time montorng of medium voltage grid, using Phase Measurng Unit PMU, adopted discrete Kalman Filter over weighted least squares for more accurate estimations 
- The discrete Kalman Filter with no control input solves the problem of estimating the state of a discrete-time system process. It is suitable for 3-phase systems and solely relies on nodal synchrophasor measurement offered by PMUs.
- his prototype validates the accuracy and time latency of a real-time 3-ph state estimation process deployed in a real Active Distribution Network (ADN)
- From this viewpoint of the prototype literature, it becomes apparent that there are no easily available open-source testbeds and simulation tools to enable developing experimentations and performance evaluation of IoT aided SG systems. For this purpose, [170] is a good source of guidance.
- for industrial applications and discussed how WirelessHART can outperform ZigBee
- NB-IoT incurs latency, so it is not suitable for delay-tolerant applications, such as distributed automation and Distributed Energy Resourc
- The powerline transmission medium of the PLC technology is noisy and harsh, increasing the challenges of channel modeling [206]. Moreover, the quality of signals are adversely affected by using powerlines in SGs due to various parameters, such as the number and types of IoT devices connected through powerlines, the wiring distance between transmitters and receivers, and the network topology [186]
- We came to know that most of the communication technologies are designed by focusing HAN. However, there is a new IoT communication technology, named LoRaWAN, which is a very good candidate for NAN and WAN and it is a long range and low-power communication technology.
- data fusion technologies to filter and aggregate only useful data from multiple IoT devices, 
- Interoper- ability is defined as the ability of two or more heterogeneous networks/devices to exchange information between them, and to use the exchanged information in a common function
