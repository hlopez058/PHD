EVs come in different shapes and sizes with types of charging systems based on charging power measured in kilowatts (kW). AC charging at 120V (Level 1) or 240V (Level 2) ranges from 1.8 to 10 kW. DC fast charging (Level 3) ranges from 50 to 350kW.

Level 1 is the slowest but most readily available, because it describes a standard 120-volt three-prong plug common in modern American homes. Yes, that’s right. You can charge an EV using the same plug with which you charge your phone or laptop. In fact, most EVs come with a standard 120-volt outlet charger.

But slow charging, sometimes called “trickle charging,” using a Level 1 outlet provides only a few miles per hour of charging. It takes 10 hours of charging to get 20-50 miles of range or 40 hours of charging for up to 200 miles. Trickle charging isn’t a barrier to ownership since it’s suitable for top-ups overnight or at work, but it isn’t efficient and is not the preferred method unless you own a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.

If you rely on Level 1 charging, you may have to charge nightly or throughout the day at work, depending on your daily driving. It’s like getting gas every day, twice. It can be done, it’s just not convenient. It’s especially difficult if you’re in a multi-family unit like an apartment building or don’t have a dedicated parking spot.

Faster charging comes via a 240-volt Level 2 system. This is typically done at home utilizing the same plug as a clothes dryer or refrigerator requires. Many EV makers provide a portable 240-volt charger with an electric vehicle.

Level 2 charging is exponentially faster than Level 1 charging, providing upwards of 25-30 miles of driving range per hour. That means an 8-hour overnight charge reaps 200 miles or more of driving range.

Level 2 chargers are available for the home or public places. Prices for home charging stations have come down dramatically in the last few years, and now cost only a few hundred dollars plus installation. Before investing in an at-home charger it’s imperative to check with a qualified electrician and your utility company to determine whether your electrical panel can support a charging station. Also look for rebates and incentives for installing a Level 2 charger from local utilities and state governments.

The third type of charging is high-speed or Level 3 charging, which is available in public and commercial spaces including rest stops, shopping malls, and office buildings. Level 3 charging is also called DC Fast Charging (DCFC). This is ultra-rapid charging, with rates of 125 miles of added range in about thirty minutes, or 250 miles in about an hour.

Not all EVs can use Level 3 charging, so research is necessary to find the best EV and the best way to charge it before you make a purchase. Complicating matters, there are three types of DCFC connectors. Nissan and Mitsubishi use CHAdeMO, Tesla has a proprietary connector, and all other car companies use a Combined Charging System (CCS).
