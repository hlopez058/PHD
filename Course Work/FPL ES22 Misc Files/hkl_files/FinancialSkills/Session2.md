Definition of an Asset: A series of Cashflow
NPV : Net Present Value

Asset = CF_0 , CF_t+1, CF_t+2, CF_t+3.... CF_t+n

Dollar value of today : $0 (base currency)

Valuation = CF_0 , ($1/$0) * CF_t+1, ($2/$0) * CF_t+2,... (r) * CF_t+n ; n= number of years to evaluate


A dollar in year 0  =  a dollar * (1+r)^T in year T



Because cash is not worth the same today as in the future. 
A perpetuitry bond for a fixed interest rate results in :

r = interest rate, exchange rate 
C = cashflow

Present Value  =  C / r

- IF C is $100 and the valuation of the market at $500 then the market has declared the exchange rate to be $5 for every $1
