## The incredible inventions of intuitive AI | Maurice Conti

Maurice Conti makes the case that we have entered an augmented age and it is underpinned by the power of generative AI. Design problems have always been elusive because of the trade-off's needed in the real world to accommodate for cost, resources and schedules. The power of augmenting work processes has yet to be fully realized because of the friction in society to hand over human control over traditional engineering decisions. The standards created by professional societies have been engrained into industry to help us make better design decisions. With generative design tools we would first need to understand how to trust these systems before they could be fully integrated.
