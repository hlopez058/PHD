The fit.dat file is a space seperated file. The .ARFF format we require for Weka takes the data as a comma-seperated file format. With the python code below we can convert the file quickly with minimal human error. We can make it into a function for future use.


```python
import csv
#Local training data
#Open fit.dat file and replace each space with a comma
#this prepares it for the ARFF format
ConvertSpaceToCSV("fit.dat","fit.csv")
```


```python
def ConvertSpaceToCSV(source_file,dest_file):
    with open(source_file, "r") as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile, delimiter=' ')
        with open(dest_file, "w", newline='') as outfile:
            writer = csv.writer(outfile, delimiter = ',')
            for row in reader:
                writer.writerow(row)
```

The fit.dat file goes from the space-seperated data set to a comma-seperated data set.

Space Seperated (fit.dat):

    22 85 203 174 9 0 362 40 0
    21 87 186 165 5 0 379 32 0
    30 107 405 306 25 0 756 99 0
    ...


Comma Seperated (fit.csv):

    22,85,203,174,9,0,362,40,0
    21,87,186,165,5,0,379,32,0
    30,107,405,306,25,0,756,99,0
    ...

The .arff file needs to have the attributes created for the Weka tool to identify each of the columns as a specific attribute. Lets add the following comments and attributes to the top of the csv file and save it as an .ARFF file format for Weka.


```python
comments = """
% ADA Software Fault Training Data
% Author: Hector Lopez
% 9 attributes
% 188 instances
% fit.arff 
"""

attributes ="""

@relation fit_data_frame 

@attribute NUMUORS real 
@attribute NUMUANDS real 
@attribute TOTOTORS real 
@attribute TOTOPANDS real 
@attribute VG real 
@attribute NLOGIC real 
@attribute LOC real 
@attribute ELOC real 
@attribute FAULTS real 

@data 
"""

#Add comments and weka attribs to the csv file and save as arf
header = comments + attributes;
AddWekaFeatures("fit.csv","fit.arff",header);
```


```python
def AddWekaFeatures(source_file,dest_file,header):
    infile = open(source_file, "r");
    intext = header + infile.read();
    outfile = open(dest_file, "w");
    outfile.write(intext);
```

The final .arff file is now in a Weka format :

    % ADA Software Fault Training Data
    % Author: Hector Lopez
    % 9 attributes
    % 188 instances
    % fit.arff 

    @relation fit_data_frame 

    @attribute NUMUORS real 
    @attribute NUMUANDS real 
    @attribute TOTOTORS real 
    @attribute TOTOPANDS real 
    @attribute VG real 
    @attribute NLOGIC real 
    @attribute LOC real 
    @attribute ELOC real 
    @attribute FAULTS real 

    @data 
    22,85,203,174,9,0,362,40,0
    21,87,186,165,5,0,379,32,0
    30,107,405,306,25,0,756,99,0
    6,5,19,6,2,0,160,9,0
    21,47,168,148,7,0,352,29,0
    ...


The same methods to clean the test.dat dataset was used. But , the test.dat file is tab seperated not space seperated. We can replace the dillimiter we are using in our function and create a new one to condition our test.dat file.


```python
#Open test.dat file and replace each tab with a comma
#this prepares it for the ARFF format
ConvertTabToCSV("test.dat","test.csv");

comments = """
% ADA Software Fault Test Data
% Author: Hector Lopez
% 9 attributes
% 94 instances
% test.arff 
"""

header = comments + attributes

AddWekaFeatures("test.csv","test.arff",header);
```


```python
def ConvertTabToCSV(source_file,dest_file):
    with open(source_file, "r") as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile, delimiter='\t')
        with open(dest_file, "w", newline='') as outfile:
            writer = csv.writer(outfile, delimiter = ',')
            for row in reader:
                writer.writerow(row)
```

The completed test data set is formatted as a .arff file ready to be imported into Weka.
