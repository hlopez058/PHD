## Work Items 

### Interesting Concepts

- Power COnsumption of today: What it will look like in the future;
- Hybrid Wind/solar sites as they exist today power generation
- future of powergenreation
- Use the wind generation and show how we can contribute to the existing state using communication technologies
- reduce oepration, how to control them, and how to destirbute the network communication.
- Power Generation: Monitoring and Control of wind turbines and hybrid sites
	- State of the art
	- what are the issues in communciation and controls for wind turbines.
	- how to fix?
- How to connect and pay fee of car:
	- figure out the stats and growth rates of car trends
	- how the trends will be predicted on the generation and payment
	- communication ohurdles and how to enter it?
	- solutions : 
		- for tesla , change the battery in the battery stations
		- battery density increases and battery charging improves and what will the cost be?
		- how does  chearging a car help you 
- Langragian multiplier research
- conenctrate on using household load.
- look at the lion claim 
- reearch fuzzy logic paper
- decentralize fuzzy logic controller vs the consensus network
- understand theconcepts of the paper as a consensus network based learning or another earning algorithm
Electric Vehicle Conductive Charging Systemâ€”Part 1: General Require-ments, document IEC 61851-1:2010,  2016
- Standard for vehicle charging modes
- Quality , Type of VOltage, CS modes, and Protection Location, DC level 2, with 
- dpendent or independent parameters?
- define a cost function that optimizes all of the 
- Cost function (w1 * a1, w2 * a2, ....) : Designer or custoemr can design the w1,w2,w3,w4 ...
- Undertand how to   

(Paper Reviews)
- EV batteries charging in and out

    - Batteries for power market can fluctuate state of charges used for power systesm
    - Batteries for cars are not meant to fluctuate as much
        - car batteries are ntoe meant ot beused for frequency regulation
    Can we find the optimal combination between car batteries and power batteries?
    - What does that involve?
    - heat degraes batteries faster, long term batteries are not meant for cycling to many times
- Strategizing with EV batteries
    - seems complicated
    - how do you coordinate many cars to charge 

- Dont know of the capabilities of the battery and dont know if its usable. 
- knowing the health of the battery.. can help you 
- Renewabl energy of the building, can be coordinated, 
    - 10 datapoints from tesla, to provide information 

Accurate enough to be safe,
