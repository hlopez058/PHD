### Ideas and Interesting Concepts
- Power COnsumption of today: What it will look like in the future;
- Hybrid Wind/solar sites as they exist today power generation
- future of powergenreation
- Use the wind generation and show how we can contribute to the existing state using communication technologies
- reduce oepration, how to control them, and how to destirbute the network communication.
- Power Generation: Monitoring and Control of wind turbines and hybrid sites
	- State of the art
	- what are the issues in communciation and controls for wind turbines.
	- how to fix?
- How to connect and pay fee of car:
	- figure out the stats and growth rates of car trends
	- how the trends will be predicted on the generation and payment
	- communication ohurdles and how to enter it?
	- solutions : 
		- for tesla , change the battery in the battery stations
		- battery density increases and battery charging improves and what will the cost be?
		- how does  chearging a car help you 
- Langragian multiplier research
- conenctrate on using household load.
- look at the lion claim 
- reearch fuzzy logic paper
- decentralize fuzzy logic controller vs the consensus network
- understand theconcepts of the paper as a consensus network based learning or another earning algorithm
Electric Vehicle Conductive Charging Systemâ€”Part 1: General Require-ments, document IEC 61851-1:2010,  2016
- Standard for vehicle charging modes
- Quality , Type of VOltage, CS modes, and Protection Location, DC level 2, with 
- dpendent or independent parameters?
- define a cost function that optimizes all of the 
- Cost function (w1 * a1, w2 * a2, ....) : Designer or custoemr can design the w1,w2,w3,w4 ...
- EV batteries charging in and out
- Batteries for power market can fluctuate state of charges used for power systesm
- Batteries for cars are not meant to fluctuate as much
- car batteries are ntoe meant ot beused for frequency regulation
- Can we find the optimal combination between car batteries and power batteries?
- What does that involve?
- heat degraes batteries faster, long term batteries are not meant for cycling to many times
- Strategizing with EV batteries
- seems complicated
- how do you coordinate many cars to charge 
- Dont know of the capabilities of the battery and dont know if its usable. 
- knowing the health of the battery.. can help you 
- Renewabl energy of the building, can be coordinated, 
- 10 datapoints from tesla, to provide information 

## Questions
- What if an EV had many points on the body of the car that allowed for multiple charging connectors to interface with it? Could this allow for even faster charging of different batteries located in different areas of the car? could this multiply the energy absorbed?

- HOw do you blackstart a windturbine? Battery is needed to feed the auxiliary turbine control systems. Ue the voltage off the stator and feed it back to the line side? Can a battery be used to handle precharge current on the wind tubrine and handle any dips as needed. the windturbine inverters need to go from grid following to gird fomring. - if you could measure the feeder reactive power consumption when the site is offline (no wind), this could then be the chraging current needed to do a black start- 
- A time syncronization is needed that will hanlde multiple turbines to connect
1. hueristics reactive power on feeeder to deteremine charging currentneeded
2. synchornized turbine connections
3. auxilliary battery to handle precharge current ( suing a DC linked battery) 
4. converter to use the grid forming setpoint
