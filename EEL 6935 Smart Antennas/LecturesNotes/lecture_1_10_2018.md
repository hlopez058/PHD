# Introduction

Technically speaking, there isno such thing as a smart antenna. The widely usedterm "smart antennas" refers to the intelligent manipulation of signals received by an array of antenna elements. Array processing of this form can easily raisethe Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR)of signals of interest, null-out or suppress interferers, identify thenumber of active signals and their direction-of-arrival and track the signal sourcesas they move in space. Due to these fundamental capabilities, array processingis playing a core role in modern mobile communication systems.EE 6935is a graduate level course designed to cover the underlying principlesand the present state-of-the-art of smart antennas and array processingalgorithms. While it is the intention of the instructor to keep EE 6935 somewhatself-sufficient, some basic working knowledge of communications systems, probabilitytheory,and signal processing is assumed. The main topics of interestare deterministic beamforming, mean-square optimum beamforming, adaptivebeamforming and direction-of-arrival estimation. Applications are soughtin the context of space-time processing for wireless communications withexamples from code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) systems.Homework assignments may require useof Matlab (or equivalent) for computer analysis and simulation studies.


# Foundation of Smart Antennas

Typical setup of a mobile-base station transmision:

![setup](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec01.png "Set-up of Cellular System")

Some signal , m(t) is bieng transmitted by the mobile on some carrier 'Fc' to the base station.

## Analog Cellular System

In older analog cellular systems the information bearing signal, m(t), is comprised of some magnitude, A, and all of the information shows up as a phase function, 'gamma'. In order to decipher the information of this type of system the signal is demodulated and the gamma function is stripped out of the carrier signal. This type of system could be considered an "FM-Type" . It was used in the 1980s but is no longer used.

## Digital Cellular System

### GSM
Europe's GSM method was a digital cellular system known as TDMA, the Time Division Multiple Access. 
A series of bits b(n) , are given an amplitude , A, and every bit is placed on some pulse with a width of T.

   ![pulsetrail](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec04.png "Pulse trail")


The pulses are then multiplied by an amplitude A and the bit polarity of either positive 1 or negative 1. 

   ![digital](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec03.png "Digital signal")

### CDMA
The CDMA system was created in the United States and stands for Code Division Multiple Access. Similar to the TDMA the CDMA system uses a digital series of bits. The difference is that instead of using a pulse function p(t-nT) , a signature waveform s(t) is used. 

   ![digitalcdma](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec05.png "CDMA")

Where L, is the spreading gain and d(l) , is the signature bit, and p(t) is the chip pulse and Tc is the chip duration.

#### Example :
Consider the sequence of Info bits is '1011'
Create a signature waveform using L=3 and a code '101'.

# Not-So-Smart Antennas

## Far-Field Assumption
Antennas are elements that receive transmissions. If there was no disturbance a signal , m(t) would arrive at an antenna on a carrier signal at some frequency , Fc. Lets consider two antennas positioned away from each other with some distance , d. Lets also consider that the transmitting signal is so far away that the transmission is seen at both antennas in such a matter that the signals are parallel. This is called the 'Far-Field' assumption.

   ![ffassumption](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec07.png "ffassumption")

Lets look at the angle of arrival, theta, of the transmitted signal with respect to the broad-side of the two antenna element arrangement in the figure.

What would be the signal at antenna element 2? The signal would take a little bit more distance, l, to arrive at antenna 2. 

   ![sensor2dist](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec08.png "sensor2dist")

`l = sin(theta)*d`

The delay, tau, that sensor 2 experiences w.r.t sensor 1 is :

`tau = l/c` where c is the speed of light , `c = fc*lambda_c` .
Therefore the delay can be written as `tau=sin(theta)*d/(fc * lambda_c)`. The signal at the second antenna receives the same signal as antenna 1 but the time is shifted by the calculated delay tau. 

   ![sensor2](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec09.png "sensor2")

## NarrowBand Array Processing Assumption

The information bearing signal , m(t), changes slowly enough that it allows me to assume that its about equal to, m(t-tau). This assumption allows us to take another look at the signal at antenna 2 in the previous example. The signal at atenna 2 is what is recieved at antenna 1 with a new term. the new term isa function of the angle of arrival , theta, and the distance between the antennas, d.

## Uniform Linear Array of M Elements

Using a general form of the previous example a linear array of antenna elements can be designed as follows :

   ![ulm](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec12.png "ulm")

Each elements signal can be grouped together into a vector based on theta. This is called the "Array Response Vector" :

   ![signalvector](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec13.png "signalvector")

# Array Processing - Linear

Given a uniform linear array of M elements take the signal of each element and "mix" them with "weights", w. The weights are any complex number with some magnitude and any phase.each weight's conjugate value will be multiplied by the signals. All the signals are then summed together and output as y(t).


   ![araypros](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec14.png "araypros")

Define the weights and the signals as vectors so that the output, y(t) can be re-written using the "hermitian" notation applied to transpositiona and conjugation of the weights vector. This is the most compact form of the output of an antenna array system.

   ![araypros](lecture_1_10_2018_img/lec14.png "araypros")


# Array Processing - NonLinear

Nonlinear processing can be considered by assuming non-linear processors that do not just  multiply by weights and sum the signals  but uses nonlinear manipulations to adjust the signals in order to create the output

An example of an application of processing would be to only receive signals from one particular direction and ignore all other incoming signals from other directions. 

# Summary :
1. Different types of cellular transmission systems
    * Analog FM-Type
    * Digital TDMA
    * Digital CDMA
2. Assuming far-field , and narrow-band an array response vector can be defined for a uniform linear array of M elements.
3. A linear processing of the input vectors with the weights will produce a output of an array of linear array elements.
4. Adjusting the weights of a linear array can create various responses.
