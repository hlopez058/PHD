# Review of the Uniform Antenna Array System

## Uniform Antenna Array 

Lets say that somewhere far away there is a transmitter that transmits a signal `m(t)`, and it is on a carrier of `e^(j*2*PI*fc*t)`. Lets also say that there is an antenna array arranged in a linear fashion. There could be an amount of, `M` antennas in the array with a distance between each element of , `d`. We can then draw a line down all the antenna's and then draw a perpendicular line to the array, that defines the "broad-side" of the array. Lets assure that this signal that is coming from far away is recieved by the antenna array at an angle of arrival with respect to the broadside at some angle `theta`.

## Array Response Vector

If antenna element1 is the reference element and the signal that arrives at element1 is exactly `m(t)*e^(j*2*PI*fc*t)` , we can start to name the each signal arriving at each antenna as `x_1(t)`,`x_2(t)`,...,`x_M(t)`. Then a vector of these signals can be defined as `X(t)`.  The "Array-Response" vector can be written as :

![lec02](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec02.png "array response vector")
 
 The array-response vector contains the multiple of the distance between each element, the angle of arrival and the speed of light times the wavelength of the signal. 

The Array-Response Vector is important because it defines how the antenna array responds to any new signal that is received. 

## Processing Signals

Each antenna element signal is weighted with a corresponding value. These weights can be defined by a weight vector such as  `w_1(t)`,`w_2(t)`,...,`w_M(t)` . After weighting all the inputs we can sum them up and produce a final output `y(t)`. Notice that the output is scalar. The final output after linear processing by all the weights is the sum of all the wieghted inputs.

![lec03](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec03.png "youtputs")

We shall focus on adjusting the weights to change the behaviour of the antenna array for different purposes. The weight shall be an arbitrary complex number defined by a magnitude `A`, and a phase `gamma`. If we could only adjust the phase then this a phased array, where one can only adapt to the phase. 

![lec04](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec04.png "weights")

When defining the weights as a vector we can rewrite the conjugation of the wieght in our output formula using the hermitan operator wich is jus the transposing and conjugation operators in one notation.

### Non-Linear Alternative

We shall only focus on linear processing but an alternative method is to use a neural net in place of the lienar weights vector. This increases the complexity but allows a training method to achieve the desired output. We shall find that a linear approach is just as good as a non-linear approach and is simpler to achieve our objectives.

# Assignment # 1

Consider the most trivial of all linear array processors that has beamformer weight values `w_i = 1 for every i = 1,2...M ` assume that a unit-value signal `(m(t)=1)` on a carier frequency  `fc` is arriving at your antenna array with a direction of arrival `theta`. Assume inter-element spacing equal to half the carrier wavelenth , `d=lambda_c/2`. 

Plot the array output `|y|^2` in plain scale and in dB log-scale as a function of `theta` for `M=3,5,10` (this is known as a power pattern or power beam pattern). 

What do you observe? Discuss your findings. Would an array with fixed unit weights like that (plain adder) be useful in some way?

# Element Spacing

Consider two elements in a linear array seperated by a distance `s` . Lets continue to imagine a perpendicular line to the array that a signal can be measured against it making an angle of arrival called `theta`. 

![lec08](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec08.png "spacing")

Antenna arrays consider two dimensions, space and time. Sample x(s,t) uniformally in space w spacing  `d` at `t=t0`. in a wa such that we are able to reconstruct the whole  space function x(s,t0) from its samples `x(md,t0), m=0,+/-1,+/-2,...` .

In other words is there any spacing `d` that would allow us to go fro the sample values to any value inbetween without having an actual element sensor there. Can it be done regardless of the angle of arrival, `theta`?

## Nyquist Theorem in Frequency Domain

Lets apply the Nyquist theorem to the space variable `s` instead of the time variable, beacuse our time variable is fixed at `t0`. The nyquist theorem says we should use a sampling rate that is twice as fast as your highest frequency.

The space sampling frequncy needs to be greater than or equal to two times the max of the spatial frequency component .

![lec09](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec09.png "spatial freq")

Take the fourier transform of the x(s,t) with respect to s can be solved as follows. Any term that does not have an s remains a constant. So we can remove our first term. We are left with the `e^()` term that contains an `s`. When an`e^()` term is converted to fourier it turns into a dirac function or an impulse. The components of the exponetial are used to move it along the axis in the frequency spectrum.

![lec10](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec10.png "spatial freq")

In this case the impulse is placed at `-sin(theta) / lamda_c` . We an now find the `fspace_sampling = 1/d >= 2* | sin(theta) / lambda_c | = 2*|sin(theta)|/lambda_c ` . Where `lambda_c = c/fc` , c = speed of light and fc = the carrier frequency. To complete the analysis we must make it agnostic to theta. We can use the following rule to solve for d. 

![lec11](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec11.png "spatial freq")

In conclusion to reconstruct any recieved signal across the linear array we must not exceed the distance between elements that is half the wavelength of the carrier frequency.

## Violating Maxmimum Nyquist Spacing

Example: 
`M=2 , w=w2=1, i.e. y(t) = x1(t)+x2(t) and m(t)=1`

Plot the square magnitude of y(t);

Set `d = lambda_c/2`

Array Beam Pattern in dB:
`G(theta) = 10*log_10*|y(theta)|^2` 

Normalized Array Beam Pattern :
`G(theta) = 10*log_10*|y(theta)|^2/M^2` 


![lec16](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec16.png "arraybeam pattern")


![lec12](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec12.png "arraybeam pattern")


Notice that with two trivial omnidirectional antenna elements we have created a directional antenna. How does the graph change when `d=lamda_c` and violates our Nyquist spacing ?

![lec13](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec13.png "arraybeam pattern_violate")

The system picks up everything above and below 30 and -30 degrees. Anything around the lobes is filtered out. This is feature that could be beneficial when designing ways to ignore interference or other signals. 

So lets look at what happens when  `d=1.5*lamda_c` ?
It is another system that is able to create nulls at new points at +/-90 deg.

![lec14](lecture_1_12_2018_img/lec14.png "arraybeam pattern_violate")


## Real world example

Say `fc=2GHz` . Then, `d=lambda_c/2 = c/fc*2 =3x10^8m/s / 2*2*10^9Hz = 3 m/s / 40 Hz = 7.5cm`
This means that antennas should be placed at most 7.5cm apart when dealing with cellphone frequencies in order to keep nyquists spacing.

## Recovering Signal from Virtual Element

How do you recover `x(s,t0)` from `x(m*d,t0), m=0,+/-1,+/-2 ...`

### Interpolation:
Use the convolution with the sinc function to create an interpolation. The second term can be replaced by the "sinc(1/d*s)" function.
