# What happened when LO3 Energy met staff at the US senate to discuss the future of Energy?

Lawrence Orsini

|September 14, 2018

### Last week, I had an engaging discussion with US Senate staff about the future of Energy – and the take-aways, proposals and future vision proved to be extremely interesting…
When people look at anything blockchain they see the weight of what’s out there and conclude that it’s cryptocurrency, but the use of blockchain as a cryptocurrency in the energy space has marginal value – the settlement of electricity bills is not broken, we have accounting methods that manage that pretty well. Its biggest potential value is actually in handling data and managing grids, and we spent much of the day discussing various topics related to this.

## Data security
The data security issue is a big one. Europe has already gone through GDPR, and there’s now a big conversation in the US about personal data.

You may think grid data is just about electricity, but the development and use of complex disaggregation software can give smart meters the ability to determine exactly how homes and the people in them consume energy. That in turn can reveal a lot about our lifestyles – and that raises it up to a personal data security question.

So we had some good conversations around the ownership of data and the notion that if a consumer has paid for a meter, there are big questions over who actually owns those meters and the data they collect.

I explained that by using the Exergy platform we’d have the ability to secure the data collected by any device and turn it into a cryptographic asset. That asset would belong to the user and would not only be protected but would be something of value that someone like Google, Amazon or an energy services company might want to buy.

There was a broad understanding that data ownership will continue to be a really sticky issue and that understanding who has access and control of it is a pretty top priority.

## Grid infrastructure

We talked about the physical grid architecture, how generation and load profiles on the grid are changing so dramatically and what we are going to have to do about it.

On the generation side, there’s a lot more distributed renewables going into the grid now and they are intermittent. In some places, like California, they are actually curtailing production of solar to bring on more combined cycle 

and gas plants for base load to balance out that intermittency.

On the load side, the problems really came to light when we started to get into a deep conversation about how electric vehicles are changing the face of transportation.

The power required for just one EV charge is equivalent to the amount an entire house uses in three full days, according to the Green Alliance report, so even a single charge of an electric vehicle sits as a major event load on the local network. That’s ok with the numbers on the road now, but there’s simply no way we are going to afford the investment for new infrastructure that can support 20-30 percent penetrations, let alone the 70 percent some of our leaders globally are looking to push toward.

Source: [How consumer choice is changing the UK energy system.](http://www.green-alliance.org.uk/resources/People_power_how_consumer_choice_is_changing_UK_energy_system.pdf)

The only option is to create a platform that allows you to align the charge and discharge of these big loads.

There was pretty broad agreement that we have to change the way we are building and managing the grid and I gave my view that the biggest issue is how we compensate utilities. We pay them the wrong way. Right now we pay them to build bigger grids, not smarter grids.

# Grid+ Raises $29 Million as Blockchain Fever Grows

The startup is using blockchain to cut out the middleman in electricity sales.

JASON DEIGN SEPTEMBER 22, 2017

Grid+, one of a growing number of energy-related blockchain ventures, has raised $29 million in presales before even going public.

_**Correction: GTM previously cited a CryptoCoinsNews [report](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/energy-startup-grid-ico-presale-raises-40-million/) that incorrectly stated Grid+ raised $40 million from its pre-sale event.**_ _**However, the company confirmed it actually [raised $29 million](https://blog.gridplus.io/official-grid-token-pre-sale-recap-8a4088baee3d) from the pre-sale, which amounts to 36,422,909 GRID tokens. GTM has updated this story to reflect the correct dollar amount.**_

_**Grid+ acknowledged it made [some errors](https://blog.gridplus.io/pre-sale-recap-v2-5c46702e5bf3) in its pre-sale calculations, and ultimately sold fewer tokens than initially thought. The errors had no bearing on the total dollar amount raised, however. With the pre-sale complete, that leaves 53,577,091 GRID tokens for sale in Grid+'s [public token sale](http://gridplus.io/token-sale) taking place October 30.**_

The startup, owned by New York blockchain development house ConsenSys, had to shut down the presale of its GRID tokens due to “overwhelming interest,” Grid+ said [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/gridplus_energy/status/907376202326802432). “Any new interest will officially be moved to a waitlist.”

Each GRID token gives the owner the right to purchase 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity at wholesale prices. The actual purchase of electricity will be via cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, BOLT and possibly Bitcoin in the future.

Grid+ had earmarked 45 million GRID tokens for the presale, which was available to participants contributing at least $50,000 and completing an anti-money-laundering screening process. 

Presale participants were given a discount on the value of GRID tokens, ranging from $0.90 a token for people putting in $50,000 to $0.75 per token for customers investing $3 million or more. In the public initial coin offering (ICO) due Oct. 30, each GRID token will cost $1.15. 

In total, Grid+ hopes to make $75 million on the sale of 90 million GRID tokens, out of a total of 300 million minted by the company. Following the pre-sale, that leaves 53,577,091 GRID tokens available for Grid+'s public token sale taking place October 30.

Of the remaining 210 million tokens, 90 million will be used for future customer acquisition and 60 million each will be held by Grid+’s external owners and its current and future employees.

The company is aiming to pull in up to 20,000 customers by the end of next year and 100,000 by the end of 2019, at which point it expects to be processing around 120 gigawatt-hours of electricity purchases a month using the blockchain. 

The company will also start licensing its technology to utilities worldwide from 2019 and is preparing to announce a utility partnership next month, Karl Kreder, director of energy at ConsenSys, told GTM.

Grid+ is aiming to slash consumer electricity bills by giving users direct access to deregulated energy markets, starting with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas next year.

“It’s common practice for electricity retailers to buy wholesale energy and sell it to their customers at over a 100 percent markup,” revealed the company in [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwkjAXom_6U&feature=youtu.be). “This is a very high price to pay for a company that is only responsible for billing you.”

Using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology and information from smart meters, Grid+ intends to cut out this middleman and offer electricity at near-market prices, buying energy wholesale on behalf of its customers.

“If Grid+ customers can anticipate their future demand, they can also purchase energy in advance at typically lower and less volatile prices,” said Grid+ co-founder Alex Miller in [a blog post](https://blog.gridplus.io/the-p2p-grid-we-all-want-d7b1b923f02c).

“This provides an immediate benefit to both Grid+ customers and the electrical grid. If Grid+ customers can predict their energy usage more accurately than a traditional retailer, as well as respond to market pricing, they will not only save money but will also increase grid reliability," wrote Miller.

Another feature of the system is real-time payment. “Traditional electricity retailers have customers buy electricity on a credit basis,” said Kreder. “Grid+ is using blockchain to allow real-time payments of electricity.”

People with rooftop solar panels, meanwhile, will be able to choose when it makes most financial sense to sell their electricity back to the market via Grid+. Having access to market pricing could provide an incentive for solar panel owners to invest in storage, Miller said.

“A battery can be turned into a revenue stream if it purchased power when it was cheap and sold that power back when it was expensive,” he noted.

Miller acknowledged that you don’t need a blockchain to set up a virtual utility along these lines. The point of using a blockchain, which in Grid+’s case is Ethereum, is to allow future peer-to-peer energy trading between prosumers.

“Ethereum becomes useful for the future state of the electrical grid where there are more distributed energy resources and dynamic distribution charges which will create more localized pricing,” wrote Miller.

Grid+ is not the only blockchain company to try this. Earlier this month, an Australian startup called Power Ledger pulled in AUD $17 million (USD $13.5 million) through token pre-sales based on a premise almost identical to Grid+’s.

Power Ledger is hoping to raise more than AUD $30 million (USD $23.8 million) when it goes public. But while Grid+ may not be unique, observers are impressed with its vision and pedigree.

“I think that Grid+, being a ConsenSys company, has a genuine solution toward P2P applications and other business models, unlike other companies in the sector,” said Francois Sonnet, co-founder of ElectriCChain, an energy generation data project.

“We keep an eye out on such ICOs and look forward to cooperating with the most serious of them.”

Grid+, Power Ledger and [LO3 Energy](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/siemens-joins-growing-blockchain-bandwagon) were among the most promising contenders, he said.

GTM CEO Scott Clavenna observed: “It's becoming clear that the barrier to entry for an ICO is so low that many are terrible ideas at best, outright fraud at worst. In this case, like Power Ledger, there is a fully fleshed-out idea, growth plan and team of experts."

“It's still a very early-stage investing opportunity, versus a true IPO, but it has the ingredients of a real startup addressing a market opportunity," said Clavenna.

With the increasing pressure on global resource and environment, the issue of utilizing renewable energy sources (RES) has become more and more important in the world. While electric power is an indispensable energy for modern world, renewable power has been emerged as an effective way for promoting the development of renewable energy(Wang and Zhan, 2019)

So far, while microgrid has many advantages, such as suppressing power fluctuation of RES, black start, and supporting active/reactive power, there are some challenges that need to be overcome for microgrid development, including substantial capital investment and uncertain environment associated with its investment and deployment (Soshinskaya et al., 2014)

Note that energy storage system (ESS), as an indispensable component of MG, has become the most critical element for microgrid development (Zubieta, 2016), in this study, we give emphasis on the issue of ESS in microgrid. The storage system in microgrid could deal with the arduous imbalance between power supply and demand as well as suppress probable power fluctuation caused by the volatility of distributed generation (Faisal et al., 2018).

- Owners of distributed energy assets can help to manage energy demand more effeciently and enable a mix of clean energy into the grid. In order to do this it is important for owners to act as proactive consumers and actively participate in the energy market. In FiT, prosumers with rooftop solar panels can sell their excess solar energy to the grid and can buy energy again from the grin in case of an energy deficiency. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-peer energy trading with sustainable user participation A game theoretic approach]] #prosumers #FiT #DERs 
- Prosumers particpating in FiT schems have only gained marginal benefits, as a consequence FiT schemes have been discontinued in some parts of the world. [[Custom Papers/References#Three-party energy management with distributed energy resources in smart grid]] #FiT
- Peer-To-Peer (P2P) trading has emerged as a next generation energy management techniqe for smart grid that can enable prosumers to actively participate in the energy market, consequently providing more benefit than Feed-in-Tarrifs. [[Custom Papers/References#Grid influenced peer-to-peer energy trading]] #FiT #P2P #definition
- P2P trading is expected to provide more gain to prosumers since it would enable control of setting the terms of the transactions as well as the delivering of goods and services. [[Custom Papers/References#Using peer-topeer energy-trading platforms to incentivize prosumers to form federated power plants]] [[Custom Papers/References#A motivational game-theoretic approach for peerto-peer energy trading in the smart grid]] #P2P #benefit
- The grid consists of generators, retailers and distribution network system providers (DNSPs). Using P2P energy trading, these entities can obtain significant benefit in terms of reducing peak demand [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer energy trading in a Microgrid]], lowering investment and operational costs [[Custom Papers/References#Designing microgrid energy markets - A case study The Brooklyn Microgrid]], minimizing reserve requirements [[Custom Papers/References#Blockchain technology in the energy sector A systematic review of challenges and opportunities]], and improving power system reliability. #P2P #benefit 
- Trading in a P2P network is challenging because proxumers are expected to trade energy with one another with a very low influence from a central controller, making the P2P platform a trustless system. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #P2P #challenges
- In an energy system with a large number of users, it is difficult to model the decision making process for various energy trading parameters given their rational choices that can conflict with the interests of other prosumers in the network. [[Custom Papers/References#Transforming energy networks via peer-to-peer energy trading The potential of game-theoretic approaches]] #P2P #challenges 
- Electricity exchange is different from any other exchange of goods. The hard technical constraints on energy exchange create copmlexity in brokering a market and settling the exchange amongst external forces that could disrupt the negotiated transactions in real-time. Decentralization could be detrimental in maintaining the technical limit of hte network within the safety range. [[Custom Papers/References#Decentralized P2P energy trading under network constraints in a low-voltage network]] #P2P #challenges #requirements 
- In a P2P network prosumers may request services with different objectives in mind.  Pricing schemes to prioritize requests are needed. These schemes need to non-congested service throughout the entire network, while keeping the network loss at a minimum. [[Custom Papers/References#Exogenous cost allocation in peer-to-peer electricity markets]] #P2P #challenges #requirements

## P2P Trading: Overview of Network Elements
- Distributed network architecture can be defined as a P2P network, if the participants of the network share a part of their own resources with one another. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #P2P 
- In a P2P network, any entity can be removed or added, if necessary, without the network suffering from any loss of network service. [[Custom Papers/References#A motivational game-theoretic approach for peerto-peer energy trading in the smart grid]] #P2P #requirements 
- P2P networks can be divided into two layers: 1) virtual layer and 2) physcial layer. The virtual layer essentially provides a secured connection for participants to decied on their energy trading parameters. It ensures that all participants have equal access to a virtual platform. The virtual platform facilitates the transfer of buy and sell orders, and financial transactions. The physical layer is a physical network that facilitates the transfer of electricity from sellers to buyers once the financial settlements between both parties are completed over the virtual layer platform. It can be a traditional distributed-grid network maintained by the indpendent system operator or an additional seperate phsyical microgrid distribution grid, in conjunction with the traditional grid. [[Custom Papers/References#Transforming energy networks via peer-to-peer energy trading The potential of game-theoretic approaches]] #P2P #requirements #virtual #physical
- Financial settlements between different prosumers in the virtual platform does not warrant the physcial delivery of electricity; rather, the payment can be thought of as indication from the buyers to their producing prosumers within the P2P network to process the injecting of renewable energy into the distribution grid. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #P2P #physical #financial #requirements 
- The P2P Information system needs to be able to: 1) enable all market participants to communicate with one another for participating in energy trading; 2) integrate the participants within a suitable market platform; 3) give the participants equal access to the market; 4) monitor the market operation; and 5) set restrictions on participant's decisions to ensure network security and reliability. #P2P  #platform #requirements #virtual #information
- Examples of information systems for P2P networks include blockchain-based smart contracts [[Custom Papers/References#Local electricity storage for blockchainbased energy trading in industrial Internet of Things]], consortium blockchain[[Custom Papers/References#Consortium blockchain for secure energy trading in industrial internet of things]], and Elecbay. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer energy trading in a Microgrid]] #P2P #examples #platform #virtual #information 
- Market operations of a P2P network consists of payment rules, and a clearly defined bidding format. The main objective is to enable an effecient energy trading process by matching the sell and buy orders in near real-time granularity. In market operations the generation of each producer influences the thresholds of maximum and minmum energy allocation. Different market-time horizons may exist in the market operation that should be able to produce enough allocation at every stage of operation. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #P2P #market #requirements #virtual 
- Pricing mechanisms are used to efficiently balance between energy supply and demand. In traditional electricity markets, a significant portion of electricity price consists of surcharges and taxes.  However, renewable energies have very low marginal costs allowing prosumers to reap more benefirst by suitable setting prices.[[Custom Papers/References#Designing microgrid energy markets - A case study The Brooklyn Microgrid]] #pricing #virtual #requirements #P2P 
- P2P trading can be done for both grid-connected and islanded microgrid systems. For balancing the energy demand and generation in a grid-connected system, it is important to define the connection points of the main grid. Smart meters are connected at each point to evaluate the performance of the network. [[Custom Papers/References#Transforming energy networks via peer-to-peer energy trading The potential of game-theoretic approaches]] #P2P #trading #microgrid #smart-meters #requirements #physical 
- Islanded microgrids should have enough generation capacity to ensure an appropriate level of security and reliability in supplying energy to consumers. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #microgrid #physical #requirements 
- Metering infrastructure is required to participate in P2P trading. Each prosumer should be equipped with a transactive meter, in addition to a traditional energy meter. A transactive meter is capable of deciding whether to participate in the P2P market based on the demand and generation data as well as the information available about market conditions (price, total demand, total available generation, and network conditions). It can also communicate with other prosumers in the network by any appropriate communication protocol. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #smart-meters #P2P #trading #requirements #physical 
- Communication infrastructure for P2P trading networks should fulfill the performance requirements recommended by the IEEE 1547.3-2007. The standard covers the latency, throughput, reliability, and security requirements needed for Dispatchable Energy Resources (DER's). [[Custom Papers/References#Comparative analysis of P2P architecture for energy trading and sharing]] #P2P #physical #IEEE #DERs #requirements #communication
- Market participants change the P2P market mechanism and affects the design of the pricing schemes. The form of energy that is traded by the participants can also change the design of the market. 
- Regulation is key to the success of P2P trading inthe future electricity markets. The governmental rules of a country decide what kind of market design will be allowed, how taxes and fees will be distributed and how the it will exist and supply systems.[[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #P2P #requirements #regulation 

## P2P Trading: Overview of Market Structure
- P2P energy trading would require decentralized management and collaborative principle that will allow for a bottom-up approach to empower prosumers. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-peer and community-based markets A comprehensive review]] #P2P #trading #market #requirements 
- Fully decentralized markets allow for prosumers to independently and directly negotiate with each other to decide on energy trading parameters without any centralized supervision by leveraging bilateral contracts between prosumers. #market #decentralized #trading 
- In a fully decentralized maket the bilateral contracts capture both the upstream-downstream energy balance as well as forward market uncertainty.[[Custom Papers/References#Bilateral contract networks for peer-to-peer energy trading]] #market #bilateral #trading #decentralized 
- In multi-bilateral economic dispatch prosumers with energy demand can choose preferences for the type of energy source such as local, or green energy.[[Custom Papers/References#Consensus-based approach to peer-topeer electricity markets with product differentiation]] #market #bilateral #dispatch #preferences
- Decentralized markets can be based on consensus to cordinate local generation, flexible load, and storage devices within a microgrid to derive a distributed economic dispatch algorithm. [[Custom Papers/References#Designing microgrid energy markets - A case study The Brooklyn Microgrid]] #microgrid #decentralized #consensus #algorithm
- Community-based market can be applied to community microgrids and group of neighboring prosumers. The members of hte community share common interests and goals even though they are not at the same location. They may work either in a collaborative or competitive manner. Participants generally trade energy through a community manager. The community manager manages exchanges outside of the community. Privacy is preserved by the community manager.

- Composite market combines the fully decentralized and community-based market designs. An individual prosumer can engage in P2P trading between each other, while also interacting with existing markets like fully distributed markets.

## P2P Trading: Overview of Existing Challenges
-  P2P trading is meant to address challenges related to energy trading including reducing the cost of energy usage, increasing and maintaining the sustainable use of renewable energy and improving social engagement of prosumers. The hard constraints imposed by power network operators can not be violated by prosumer's nodes, as well as the requirement of keeping overall network losw within reasonable limits. [[Custom Papers/References#Peer-to-Peer Trading in Electricity Networks An Overview]] #challenges #P2P #requirements 
-  Trading challenges in virtual layer of P2P trading consist of 1) Reducing cost of energy, 2) Balancing local generation and demand, 3) Incentivizing & engaging prosumers, 4) Developing pricing mechanisim, 5) Identifying uncertainty and asynchronicity, 6) Securing transactions. #challenges #virtual #trading #requirements 
-  Trading challenges in the physical layer of a P2P trading platform consist of 1) grid-connected power network constraints, 2) Violation of voltage and capacity constraints, 3) increse in network power loss and 4) loss of system strength. #physical #trading #challenges 
-  In P2P trading financial transactions are required to be securely conducted without a third party manager and should.

# Transforming Energy Networks via Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading
## Introduction
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has emerged as a next-generation energy-mangement mechanism for the smart grid that enables each prosumer of the network to particpate in energy trading with other prosumers and the grid. [[Custom Papers/References#Transforming energy networks via peer-to-peer energy trading The potential of game-theoretic approaches]] #P2P #definition 
- In P2P networks particpants are motivated to achieve different energy-management goals. To ensure effecient operation a mathematical model that leverages game-theoretic approaches for simulation can best model the energy trading strategies of market participants.[[Custom Papers/References#Transforming energy networks via peer-to-peer energy trading The potential of game-theoretic approaches]]  #P2P #game-theory #market 
- Development of smart, sustainable and green solutions are becoming more significant, including the widespread deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) at residences. [[Custom Papers/References#Three-party energy management with distributed energy resources in smart grid]] #DERs #growth 
- Feed-In-Tarrifs are not profitable for a prosumer so the need for markets that allow small-scale particpants to actively trade energy with one another in real time and facilitate a sustainable and reliable balance between the generation and consumption of energy is needed. [[Custom Papers/References#Designing microgrid energy markets - A case study The Brooklyn Microgrid]] #FiT #market #growth #requirements 
- P2P energy trading is considered a tool to promote the use of DERs within the energy grid. Its main objective is to break the centralized infrastructure of the electricity grid by allowing the direct communication and supply of energy between various prosumers with DERs within the energy system. [[Custom Papers/References#Designing microgrid energy markets - A case study The Brooklyn Microgrid]] #P2P #definition #DERs #decentralized 
- Modeling the decision-making process of each market participant is a challenge. The model would need to take into account human factors, such as reationality, motivation and environmental friendliness. There is further complexity when their are conflicting interests in reducing costs, maximizing revenues, and pursuing renewable energy objectives. [[Custom Papers/References#Transforming energy networks via peer-to-peer energy trading The potential of game-theoretic approaches]] #P2P #pricing #challenges #market #preferences #modeling 
- Energy trading schemes are typically real-time and time-of-use pricing, but P2P trading would incorporate independent decision maker with power to arbitratily sell at varying rates to different buyers within the network.

# What recent trials teach us about peer-to-peer power trading

[By Matthew Farmer](https://www.power-technology.com/author/mattfarmer/)27 Aug 2020

Power Technology takes a look at one of the most recent peer-to-peer energy trading trial, and what it can teach early adopters.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading continues to undergo trials across the world, looking at how it might change energy generation and consumer attitudes to renewable energy. Power Technology took a look at how one of the most recent trials fared, and what those involved learned about P2P trading.

P2P technology would enable households with their own power generation installations to sell electricity directly to each other. This would cut power companies out of the process, allowing rooftop solar generators to trade via an online marketplace.

GlobalData senior power analyst Somik Das told Power Technology: “Generators and consumers involved in P2P energy trading mechanisms need not depend on utilities or retailers for their energy, and can make smart, sustainable choices about the usage and distribution of renewable energy.

“The trading platform uses blockchain technology to reconcile demand and supply of electricity to better balance the grid. It also increases efficiency, and reduces the costs of buying and selling electricity.”

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has said P2P trading would allow greater grid flexibility. The technology could also increase revenue for energy-generating households, known as prosumers. In some cases, it could allow communities to withstand power shortages or transmission network damage, improving energy access in some cases.
In July, IRENA listed [P2P energy trading as one of its 30 solutions](https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Jul/IRENA_Peer-to-peer_trading_2020.pdf?la=en&hash=D3E25A5BBA6FAC15B9C193F64CA3C8CBFE3F6F41) to bring about a “more flexible system allowing for a higher, cost-effective use of renewables.” It said P2P trading would “make renewable energy more accessible, empowering consumers while making better use of their distributed energy resources”.

On Tuesday, IRENA hosted an online seminar with the Malaysian Government’s Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA). SEDA sets the solar feed-in tariff for Malaysia and was tasked by the Malaysian Government to develop a roadmap to decarbonise the country’s energy systems.

As part of this, SEDA has looked to take advantage of the country’s relatively large capacity for solar generation. SEDA CEO Sanjayan Velautham said the levelised cost of solar generation has come down by 80% over the last decade. He explained why SEDA chose P2P energy trading to encourage decarbonisation, saying: “Even in the early days of evaluation, the concept of P2P trading was appealing to consumers in many ways. As in any P2P model, the concept leverages sharing economic benefits, underpinned by digital technologies, brought about by the combination of blockchain, the internet of things, smart contracts, big data, and cloud applications.”

## Malaysian trials show importance of data collection

SEDA ran a trial of P2P technology between October 2019 and June 2020. With help from regulating authorities and power utilities, the authority built an energy trading sandbox for prosumers and consumers.To allow this, SEDA had to build a data aggregator to format meter data from utility TNB and feed it into the trial’s online P2P platform. SEDA technical lead Hasril Izan bin Bahari said automating this would be essential for more widespread deployment.

## “Empowering consumers while making better use of resources

In July, IRENA listed [P2P energy trading as one of its 30 solutions](https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Jul/IRENA_Peer-to-peer_trading_2020.pdf?la=en&hash=D3E25A5BBA6FAC15B9C193F64CA3C8CBFE3F6F41) to bring about a “more flexible system allowing for a higher, cost-effective use of renewables.” It said P2P trading would “make renewable energy more accessible, empowering consumers while making better use of their distributed energy resources”.

To allow this, SEDA had to build a data aggregator to format meter data from utility TNB and feed it into the trial’s online P2P platform. SEDA technical lead Hasril Izan bin Bahari said automating this would be essential for more widespread deployment.

The trial used historical energy use data to select viable candidates and match them against each other. This avoided “spillage”, when an excess of power led to zero cost, meaning prosumers gained nothing from selling their electricity. Over the nine months, selling prices were set at 10% above the utility tariff and energy trades equated to approximately 41MWh.

bin Bahari explained that Covid-19 limited [the scope of the trial](https://www.seda.gov.my/2019/10/malaysias-1st-pilot-run-of-peer-to-peer-p2p-energy-trading/), which would have allowed participants to trade energy by offsetting their utility bills. He said: “Trading results show higher levels of untraded in energy during March, because of lower consumption due to the [pandemic] movement control orders. However, towards the end of June, we saw an improvement.”

Despite the general success of the trial, bin Bahari said retailers would still play an important role in settling bills, reducing risks from opening up networks, and becoming the “buyer of last resort”. He also said the P2P process would attract more participants if it were simplified.

## P2P energy trading remains a “solution for the future”

The Malaysian trial was one of many carried out over recent years. Das said: “A number of companies such as Centrica, Piclo, Lumenaza, Vandebron, LO3 Energy, Power Ledger, SunContract and Electrify have tested their P2P trading platforms which were implemented in pilot projects that were launched in different countries.

“European countries such as the UK, Germany and Netherlands, the US, Colombia, Australia, Bangladesh, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and others have started implementing or have successfully implemented P2P energy trading pilot projects which resulted in reduction of overall operational costs of the power system and saving energy bills for customers.”

The Malaysian trial used technology developed by Australian start-up Power Ledger. Their system uses [blockchain technology](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2019/Sep/IRENA_Blockchain_2019.pdf) to verify transactions without the need for an overseeing body.

Power Ledger has developed a platform for P2P trading. Beyond this, its platform can manage power within a microgrid, from battery storage, or trace power from purchase agreements. It currently operates across ten countries.

Power Ledger head of business development Vinod Tiwari said P2P trading would encourage photovoltaic solar generation, as 95% of Malaysia’s power come from fossil fuels.

Company co-founder and executive chairman Jemma Green spoke at the IRENA seminar, giving results from the Malaysian trial. She said: “For those markets looking to scale renewables, it’s important to learn from the challenges experienced in other markets with high penetration of renewables.

“In Western Australia, high solar generation during the day can cause issues such as reverse flows of electricity, reactive power, and grid balancing issues, including frequency control challenges.”

Das continued: “Peer-to-peer energy trading is in a nascent stage and is a solution for the future.

“P2P trading will transform power sector through increased deployment of distributed renewable sources such as solar, increases fle
