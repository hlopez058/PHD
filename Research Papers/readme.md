## Enhancing Reliability of Power Systems through IIoT
- Claims about Industry 5.0
- As per IEEE electrical failure is three times more likely without preventative maitenance
- Industries are moving into conditin based monitoring
- CBM is a process to identify where failure starts to occur and decide to complete maintenance at a point before part losses its expected performance.
- According to the DOE , predictive maitenance has huge savings
-Duke adopting a full CBM and PM strategy 
- Equipment cant fix itself, but it can be put into a condition that can mitigate the failure before it needs to be repaired
- Maitenance Supervisor Module ; Notifies data centers, and supervisors, checks if condition is correctable
- Software maitenance supervisor ; monitors memeory, cpy, reosurces etc.
- Hardware Maitenenance Supervisor ; monitors vibrations esnros, oil temps, etc.
- THe MSM , takes the inputs from the SMS and HMS and determines what to do with the condition dynamically
- Is the condition correctable or not,  if it is implement something , etc.
- Goal is to reduce human and machine interaction and thus reducing down time?
- Self corrected maitenance
- improve systems using hybrid self corrected maitenance




## Future Generation 5G Wireless Networks for Smart Grid: A Comprehensive Review
- Bringing in 5G networks in a smart grid can establish new business models at the utility side with edge and fog computing along with automation and intelligent control
-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
- 5g will be on the 3-90Ghz range,with 10Gbps, while 4g is at 2600Mhz with 100Mbps
- Massive MIMO (also known as hyper MIMO) utilizes extensive service antennas by spatial multiplexing
- several 5g architectures :
    - Multi-Tier
    - Cognitive Ragio Networks:
    - Device to Device Communication
    - Cloud Based Architecture
-  An intracellular scheduling component is another important feature to build in 5G architecture. Opportunistic scheduling of the cells
- Wireless communication is important as a reliable, efficient, and intelligent way to enhance the conventional power grids into smart grids
- home area networks HAN, interaction betwee home sensors and the utility
-by implementing the 5G network, as it enables advanced and distributed state
of the system containing the state variables at all nodes of the network from a completely remote set-
estimation schemes
- connected devices to be integrated more promptly in order to monitor energy forecasting
- 5g is a ne trend with lots of challenges 
- 5g needs to be standardized and adoption is not needed until the systems that generate energy are less predicatbla
