### Review: 
This paper uses an combined architecture for a charging station that leverages renewable energy sources and a battery. This type of charging station takes advantage of the connected sources to minimize the strain of EV's connected directly to the Grid and creating different load profiles. The paper discusses the difficulty of defining bounds for optimal control when operating these charging stations. The authors propose that EV charging stations create a stochastic programming problem similar to a load control and demand response problem. The state variables are the battery levels, uncertain forecasts market price of energy, total wind from remote wind farm and demand of each charging station. The challenge is the optimization of all these variables , by reducing operational cost across all stations. To solve the challenge forecasts of the generated wind,PV and market are created from theoretical and simulated references. They finally discover the bounds for optimal control by calculating two stochastic measures, and discover that the system is most sensitive to market fluctuations. The authors mentions that the accuracy of the market price predictions results in a stochastic gap.

 - premise is about the creating charging profiles
- a novel regional EV charging station system, with problem formulation for maximizing profit.
- attempt to charge vehicles using charging stations that are coordinated with renewable energy generation on the grid. Coordination is done virtually not directly tied. 
- studies have not focused on optimal bounds.adjustable confidence bounds.

### Review: 
The authors of this paper attempt to create a simulation of a modified Z-source inverter to act as a charger. They review how a regular Z-source inverter would work then go into very extensive detail about their modified design. The benefit of using this design is to reduce the size of the transformers in a traditional setup when trying to charge batteries from a PV source with tie in to the grid. The grid-side transformer is large and expensive. By implementing 'half-bridge-converter' mosfets with much faster switching speeds than available before the researchers attempt to measure the proof of concept. The simulation is done in Matlab and a scaled down physical system is built and presented. The findings are that as the battery voltage increases the losses of the design also increase, while the HBC losses decrease. They show various combinations when measuring losses and efficiencies to show the range of the system. In conclusion the MZSI topology is an efficient solution for semi-commercial areas that would utilize PV-Grid-Connected Energy storage. Future work would be trying to replicate this design for string inverters.

### Review:
The paper highlights the future of research in the blockchain and green iot solutions. The paper covers the virtual powerplant idea as an aggregation of prosumers and discusses the needs for democratization of energy by tracking the distributed cost of energy consumption. Fog Computing seems to be the best way for blockchain technologies in IoT to be adopted in the energy sector because it circumvents the computational and security needs for a mature network by utilizing existing infrastructure built at wind and solar sites. The paper offers an insight into the use of IoT in the energy sector by providing the breakdown of the most important component to energy constumption, HVAC follwoed by lighting. These two components can be controlled by blockchain solutions and have a great. impact. Leading to the idea that a transformation of the grid can occur when IoT networks transform the energy sector forom a centralized supply chain into a decentralized , smart and optimized system.

### Review:
The paper dives into a detailed breakdown of each segment of the smart grid. The survey results in acknowledging the lack of research in published prototypes of IoT network simulations. The smart grid architecture proposed shows the layers involved in the networks overlaying the digital network with the physical network of power transmission. Most of the research surveyed has been shown to be focused on the Home area networks or HAN's . IoT networks are built around mesh communications such as blue tooth and zigbee that allow for near field communications for systems dont require high-reliability. In a smart grid the HAN is the first layer that needs to be connected through a field area network (FAN) or nieghborhoood area network (NAN). The best solution for NAN's for IoT is LoraWan but its still not as useful for smart grid control because of the security concerns. The best NAN communicaiton tehcnology is a mix of cellular communication , wireless mesh and existing wired telecom lines. The WAN wide area network is best implemented with wired telecom lines to provide reliability needed by the smart grid. The greatest challenge of IoT penetration into the Smart Grid is the problem of interoperability. The different network solutoins do not have clear standard for various reasons described in the paper aorund regional and technical constraints.  The lack of standards causes manufacturers in HAN networks to adopt the best communication technology for the service or product that is provided. Compounding the problem smart grid technology will not change until there is economic demand to push the risk of grid stability into untested wireless communication technologies.

### Notes
- Information Flow can be overlaid on top of the Power Flow and labeled as WAN (Wide area network),NAN (nieghbordhood area network),HAN(Home Area Network) or FAN (field area network0, in accordance with Generation,Transmission,Distribution, and Consumption
- Electric vehicles can be charged or discharged in multiple ways when paired with a home. V2G , vehicle to grid, V2V , vehicle to vehicle, and V2H vehicle to home . All of these methods can be used by EV's to participate in the market as prosumers
- Smart Grid adds three main things to power grid
	- remote controlling and monitoring
	- reporting to consumer
	- integration of renewable and distributed energy resrouces
- Smart grid has 4 main subsystems
	- power generation
	- power transmission
	- power distribution
	- power utilization
- Smart grids with IoT enable
	- information flow
	- power flow
	- distribution flow
-Smart Grids use smart meters over General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) of other mobile networks
- Standards are not yet established for IoT aided SG
- This survey reveals that there is little literature on the application of IoT-aided SG systems in the area of power generation, transmission and utilization. The potential of renewable energy may depend, for example, on IoT-based prediction of weather conditions that can regulate energy flow between different regions, and on monitoring the efficiency of the involved equipment (solar panels, wind turbines).
- SGAM (Smart Grid Architecture Model) which is designed for SG planning and is the SG reference architecture by EU Mandate M/490
- REal time montorng of medium voltage grid, using Phase Measurng Unit PMU, adopted discrete Kalman Filter over weighted least squares for more accurate estimations 
- The discrete Kalman Filter with no control input solves the problem of estimating the state of a discrete-time system process. It is suitable for 3-phase systems and solely relies on nodal synchrophasor measurement offered by PMUs.
- his prototype validates the accuracy and time latency of a real-time 3-ph state estimation process deployed in a real Active Distribution Network (ADN)
- From this viewpoint of the prototype literature, it becomes apparent that there are no easily available open-source testbeds and simulation tools to enable developing experimentations and performance evaluation of IoT aided SG systems. For this purpose, [170] is a good source of guidance.
- for industrial applications and discussed how WirelessHART can outperform ZigBee
- NB-IoT incurs latency, so it is not suitable for delay-tolerant applications, such as distributed automation and Distributed Energy Resourc
- The powerline transmission medium of the PLC technology is noisy and harsh, increasing the challenges of channel modeling [206]. Moreover, the quality of signals are adversely affected by using powerlines in SGs due to various parameters, such as the number and types of IoT devices connected through powerlines, the wiring distance between transmitters and receivers, and the network topology [186]
- We came to know that most of the communication technologies are designed by focusing HAN. However, there is a new IoT communication technology, named LoRaWAN, which is a very good candidate for NAN and WAN and it is a long range and low-power communication technology.
- data fusion technologies to filter and aggregate only useful data from multiple IoT devices, 
- Interoper- ability is defined as the ability of two or more heterogeneous networks/devices to exchange information between them, and to use the exchanged information in a common function
