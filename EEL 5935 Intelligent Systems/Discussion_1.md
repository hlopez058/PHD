## The Rise of Artificial Intelligence Documentary

F. Rosenblatt proposed the "perceptron" and attempted to create a single layer neural network that could detect female/male images in the 1960's. His work was critiqued to be underperforming and not promising. Decades later J.Hinton began to extend the single layer network to multi-layer network getting around the original limitations of the neural network. Multi-layer neural networks where capable of learning how to drive a car, and recognize handwriting but was limited by the amount of data and the computing power. It wasn't until the mid 2000's that hardware along with the data from the internet would provide a resurgence of neural networks. The disadvantages of AI is the ability to be abused in the wrong hands. Justin Trudeau mentioned an optimistic path for the use of AI by encouraging best practices in the AI community in conjunction with government support. Technologies presented by Lyrebird show the potential controversies that could arise from AI. It needs to address the potential abuse of its voice mimicking technology.  


## Artificial Intelligence: Mankind's Last Invention

 Alpha-GO was an example of the power of reinforcement learning to train against it self by acting as an agent that seeks rewards in a game given set rules. It can start to create information that was not available in all of the human knowledge about the game. This provides a glimpse into the future of neural networks , machine learning and AI. New advances will keep growing as applications of the technology are powered by the exponential rise in computing and data.
